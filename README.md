## Project Journey

This is my first major Python project where I built a complete application from start to finish. I used this project to learn Object-Oriented Programming and basic software architecture in a practical way.

### Current Status – v1.1.0

- All core features for books, members, and loans implemented.
- Clean OOP structure with separate models and manager logic.
- Fully functional, menu-driven console interface.
