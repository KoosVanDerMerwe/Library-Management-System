## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python main.py` to start the application
3. Use the menu system to manage books, members, and loans
4. All data is automatically saved in the SQLite database

## 📈 Project Journey

This is my first major Python project where I built a complete application from start to finish. I took on this challenge to deeply learn Object-Oriented Programming and software architecture.

### Current Status: ✅ Version 1.0 Complete
- All core features implemented and tested
- Clean OOP architecture
- Fully functional menu system

### What's Next: 🔄 Continuous Development
This is a living project that I'll be continuously improving. Here's what I'm planning:

## 💡 Learning Focus

As I continue developing this project, I'm focusing on:
- Improving code architecture and design patterns
- Adding proper testing and documentation
- Learning web development frameworks
- Implementing best practices for database design

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3.13.9
- SQLite3
- Object-Oriented Programming Structure
